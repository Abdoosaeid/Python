President Abraham Lincoln delivered 
what is thought to be one of the most 
memorable speeches in American history 
the Gettysburg Address. Lincoln read 
the 272-word speech at the dedication 
ceremony for the Soldiers National 
Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.
After the 3-day battle at 
Gettysburg ended on July 3, 1863, more 
than 3,500 Union soldiers were buried in 
shallow unmarked graves throughout the 
battlefield. The local citizens petitioned 
Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin to 
build a special cemetery to bury more 
than 3,500 Union soldiers killed there. 
Governor Curtin approved the request for 
funding and the six-month process of 
reburying the bodies began in October 
1863.
A dedication ceremony for the 
new cemetery took place on November 
19, 1863. The main speaker that day was
Edward Everett, an orator and popular 
statesman from Massachusetts. Everett 
spoke for two hours on the battle before 
President Lincoln took the stage to 
deliver a speech lasting just two minutes.
Lincoln’s brief speech provided 
Lincoln’s vision of freedom with 
references to ideas included in the 
Declaration of Independence. 
After the dedication President 
Lincoln’s and Everett’s speeches were 
reprinted in newspapers throughout the 
country Reaction to President Lincoln’s 
speech was mixed. In the south, 
newspapers attacked the speech while 
newspapers in the north were split down 
party lines with the Republicans praising 
the speech and Democrats disliking it.
There are five copies of the 
Gettysburg Address written in President 
Lincoln’s hand. Each speech is slightly 
different with words and phrases changed 
in each document. The most noticeable 
difference is the inclusion of the phrase 
“under God” in only three of the five 
copies.
Two copies, the Hay and 
Nicolay copies, are held at the Library of 
Congress. The Everett copy, written by 
Lincoln after the dedication ceremony 
and given to Edward Everett, resides at 
the Abraham Lincoln Presidential 
Library and Museum. The Bancroft copy 
is owned by Cornell University. The final 
copy, the Bliss copy, is located in the 
Lincoln Bedroom in the White House.

Extension 1: Have the students create 
their own version of the Gettysburg 
Address. Assign the students the task of 
writing a speech on the relevance of the 
Gettysburg address today in 272 words.
Extension 2: Compare the five 
versions of the Gettysburg Address and 
note the differences between each copy. 
How do the changes in each address alter 
the message? 
Extension 3: Have students select a 
person living during the Civil War era 
and write a response to the Gettysburg 
Address from their chosen person’s 
perspective.
